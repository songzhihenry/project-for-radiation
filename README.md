# **project-for-radiation**

## **Introduction**
This [Jupyter notebook]() demonstrates the apparent speed of an relativistic object(radiation source) exceeds speed of light while it's real speed is below speed of light. There are two different demo files, which show how apparent speed varies affected by 2 independent parameters.This project is based on *problem 4.7* of text book<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>.

## **Usage**
Clone the repository by typing:  
**git clone** [https://github.com/songzhihenry/project-for-radiation/](https://github.com/songzhihenry/project-for-radiation/)  
Then open the notebook. For example, on a win10 type system, type:  
**cd project-for-radiation**  
**jupyter notebook Project for Radiation Course part1.ipynb**
