# project-for-radiation
This Repo is for the project in Radiation Course based on question 4.7 in the textbook.

It should contain jupyternote book files, two movie files and readme.

The idea is to show comparasions among distance of a bright object, apparent distance observed by people on the earth, speed of the object and apparent speed.

From the theories, we know apparent speed could be larger than speed of light.

v_{app} = v*sin(\theta)/(1-v*cos(\theta)/c).
by dividing both sides by 'c', eq. above can be expressed as:

\beta_{app} = \beta*sin(\theta)/(1-v*cos(\theta)/c)

In the movie, if the angle is fixed, one would see apparent speed could exceed light speed while true speed of the object would always be smaller than speed of light.

The curve of apparent event would change from time-like to space-like and jump into outer light cone when the apparent speed exceeds light speed.

Moreover, if speed of the object is fixed below light speed somehow, one would see apparent speed exceed light speed at some certain angles possiblely.

The curve of apparent event would change from time-like to space-like at some certain angles.
